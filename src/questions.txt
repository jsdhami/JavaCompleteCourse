//        Inheritance and Polymorphism:
//
//        Create a base class Vehicle with attributes like make, model, and a
//        method startEngine(). Then, create subclasses like Car and Motorcycle
//        that inherit from Vehicle and override the startEngine() method. Create
//        instances of both subclasses and demonstrate polymorphism by calling
//        the startEngine() method on them.
